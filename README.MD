# Ahda's React Journey!

## What is ReactJS ?

An extremely popular, declarative, component-based, state-driven javascript library for building UI.

- Component-based: react takes components and draw them on the webpage.
- Declarative: telling react what a component should look like based on current state/data with JSX (html/css/js/react-component).
- State-driven: keeping UI in sync with data that are driven by events/state. (ui will "react" to state changes)

There are frameworks built on top of react such as nextJS and Remix.
